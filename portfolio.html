            <h2  id="purpose"> Purpose and Context </h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create professional portfolio for myself. This project began in November 2019 and ended in January of 2020.</p>
          </div>

            <h2  id="objective"> Objective </h2>
            <p>In order be employed as a UX designer in the future, I needed to have an accessible online space to present my burgeoning skills in user experience design and the relevant skills I already possess.</p>
            <p>A professional portfolio website gives me an online presence which I didn’t previously have and allows me to show documentation of my process.  Building this portfolio also provided me with several opportunities for growth.
</p>
            <ul>
              <li>First, the portfolio site itself is an opportunity to work on creating a usable product. One of my target audiences is potential employers. My goal is to ensure that they are able to easily access data about me such as my contact information, resume, background information and portfolio pieces. If the site is broken, confusing or isn’t pleasant to use, then I will not be able to convey my information.
</li>
              <li>Second, this portfolio website allowed me to gain a better understanding of front end development. I have always believed that teams work better when team-members have an understanding of each others jobs. I coded this site by hand and now have a more in-depth understanding of what front end development entails. I also have some insight into what challenges developers may face.
</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="anchor">
            <h2 id="insight">Process and Insights</h2>
            <p>I began by gathering, curating and taking stock of all the content I would need. Images and files were also formatted into png, jpeg and PDFs as appropriate. This project was designed using a mobile-first method. All coding and layout began with the mobile size and then screen breakpoints were added to accommodate larger screen sizes. Wireframes were used as a reference while coding.
</p>
<!-- wireframes image -->
            <p>Atom was used for the text editor and the pages were completed according to the initial wireframes. At this time, the toggle menu function was written for mobile. GitHub was used to host the portfolio project and GitHub Desktop as a git client.</p>
            <!-- atom, github desktop, github image -->
              <div>
                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>After initial HTML, CSS and JS was written, user testing for the first iteration was conducted. Several problems with the site became evident. The image below is a brief summary of the issues and which ones were addressed in the latest iteration and which will be addressed in future iterations.
</p>

                </div>
                <p>The issues addressed were selected based on severity rating and ease. All the issues with a severity rating for 3 or 4 and the issues which could be easily and quickly fixed, such as spelling errors, were addressed. </p>
                <p>To see the entire test report with script and results, please see the below</p>

              <div>
                <h3> Debugging and Cross Browser Testing</h3>
                <p>I used separate linter plugins for the HTML, CSS and JS to catch some of the basic coding errors. I ran into some issues with the linter plugins being out of date or giving strange suggestions. For example, The CSS linter was flagging all the times I had used variables for colors as a parse error. Redefinitions of properties at screen breakpoints were also being flagged. Of the linters, the JavaScript was the worst; it flagged all semicolons in the code. I ended up running the code through an online checker in addition to the plugins and only made the appropriate updates. Once this was complete, I conducted manual cross browser testing for the following browsers:
</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Chrome</li>
                  <li>Firefox</li>
                  <li>Safari</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Firefox and Safari were both formatting the InkWell project overview links in the dark accent without the underline for the first and last list item and then underlining each of the other items in the accent color (pictured below). The code was intended to underline all the links in the dark accent color when highlighted. I actually decided I liked the color differentiation because it made the link easier to identify. I reformatted so that the text and underline for all list items was the accent in hover state and dark accent with no text decoration in standard state. </p>
                <p>Firefox was also formatting with he list item bullets offset from the list item text. I removed the bullets all together because users were confusing this list with the tools and skills list on the “about” page (which is also bulleted).
</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The color palette initially chosen for this site was examined for accessibility. Most of the palette passed well, but a few changes needed to be made to meet the AA using WCAG 2.0 guidelines for contrast accessibility. </p>
                <p>
The links (accent color) on the footer (light accent) did not meet contrast requirements. So I added a specific color for links which is darker. The buttons (dark accent text on accent background) also didn’t meet requirements. A darker accent color was to the palette and it has enough contrast on the accent color to meet AA requirements. I chose this rather than using black because the black on the accent felt too stark. The accent color was also brightened to give a better contrast.
</p>
